# Desription

LogHawk is a Python-based log monitoring tool developed as part 
of the Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp Project. It monitors various system 
logs (application, system, authorization, and access logs) for suspicious 
activities and potential security threats. When suspicious logs are 
detected, they are recorded in a comprehensive log file (comp_log.txt) 
for further analysis.
